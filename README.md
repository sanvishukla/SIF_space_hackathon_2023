Despite encountering challenges with processing the provided .TIF images within the desired timeframe, we successfully trained the model on 27,000 (64,64) size images of labeled land use instances, meticulously following the specified guidelines. Remarkably, this initial training phase yielded an impressive test accuracy of 89.78%. Looking ahead, we anticipate even greater advancements in performance as we continue to train the model with the seasonal dataset provided, fostering optimism for enhanced results in the near future.
